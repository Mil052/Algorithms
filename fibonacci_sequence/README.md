# Finding nth element in Fibonacci sequence
## Algorithm description
In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

**There are three algorithms to find nth element in Fibonacci seqence:**

* In the FibonacciClosedForm_findNthElement() function I used mathematic formula to calculate nth element.
* In the FibonacciIteration_findNthElement() function I used iteration ("while loop") to calculate elements of Fibonacci sequence until nth element.
* In the FibonacciRecurrention_findNthElement() function I used recurrention to find nth element.
